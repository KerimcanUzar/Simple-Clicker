A simple clicker game.

Game automatically saves. Save folder is in C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\My Clicker

Game won't perform well after reaching very high numbers. That is made deliberatively. Why? Because didn't know how to end it.

Playing the game with a clicker will make you reach the endgame in a 2-3 hours, I think.
